# Weather App

A simple weather application that allows users to input a city name and see the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks like React used).

## Features

- **Search by City:** Users can input a city name and get real-time weather data.
- **Display Current Weather Data:** Shows the city name, temperature (in Celsius), weather description, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
- **Error Handling:** If an invalid city is entered or there's an issue with the API, the app shows an error message.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
